# **TASK MANAGEMENT APP — DESIGN SPEC v1**

**(Mixed Mode: Vision + UX + Architecture + Data Model)**

# **0. Vision: What Task Management Must Become**

NSW has thousands of untracked, unaudited, and structurally invisible tasks scattered across:

- Outlook
    
- JIRA / ADO
    
- shared drives
    
- spreadsheets
    
- emails
    
- hallway conversations
    

This fractures reality.  
Leadership cannot see workload.  
Members don’t know what they owe.  
Obligations go stale.  
Processes never actually “execute.”  
Readiness silently decays.  
Operational signals remain invisible.

**Task Management solves this by becoming:**

> **The single execution layer of NSW.  
> Every obligation, process step, request, objective, or work package  
> becomes a task with structure, ownership, traceability, and measurable impact.**

Tasks become:

- the interface between people and the semantic model
    
- the unit of work that carries operational meaning
    
- the lens through which load, stress, bottlenecks, and readiness are measured
    
- the temporal driver of Calendar and COP
    
- the empirical data for Measures & Lenses
    
- the anchoring point for cross-team coordination
    
- the gateway for integrating JIRA/ADO without breaking structure
    

This is not a to-do list.  
It is NSW’s **computable, semantic model of work.**

---

# **1. Purpose**

The Task Management App fulfills five enterprise functions:

### **1. Provide members with a clear, trustworthy list of everything they owe.**

No more inbox archaeology.  
Members see _all_ tasks, internal + external (Shadow Tasks).

### **2. Provide positions and organizations with a role-based work queue.**

Tasks belong to **positions**, not people.  
Rotations no longer break continuity.

### **3. Connect obligations, processes, objectives, requests, and work packages into one execution model.**

Every major system generates tasks that represent actionable work.

### **4. Provide leadership real visibility into workload, bottlenecks, and risk.**

The organization finally gets empirical data on throughput, admin load, friction, and readiness.

### **5. Serve as NSW’s universal integration layer for external work systems (JIRA, ADO).**

Teams remain in their preferred tools, while NSW maintains semantic coherence.

---

# **2. High-Level Conceptual Model**

At the heart of this system is the concept:

> A **Task** is an actionable unit of work tied to a **Position**, generated by a **semantic source**.

Semantic sources include:

- Governance & Policy → Obligations → Tasks
    
- How-Do → Process Steps → Tasks
    
- Objectives & Key Results → Cadences → Tasks
    
- Work Packages & Commitments → Deliverables → Tasks
    
- Service & Support Requests → Routed work → Tasks
    
- Calendar → Deadlines & upcoming events → Tasks
    
- Manual → User-created tasks
    
- External Tools (JIRA/ADO) → Shadow Tasks
    

Tasks flow through NSW like structured signals.

---

# **3. Key Features**

## **3.1 Position-Based Task Inbox**

Every position has a work queue:

- All tasks assigned to the position
    
- Tasks assigned to subordinate positions (if authorized)
    
- Task aging indicators
    
- SLA and deadline visualization
    
- Workload and stress metrics
    

Humans rotate, but work continues.

---

## **3.2 Member Personal Task View (Member Hub Integration)**

Members see:

- Tasks tied to their position
    
- Tasks directly assigned to them
    
- Tasks related to requests they initiated
    
- Tasks requiring their signature/action
    
- Shadow Tasks from JIRA/ADO
    

Every task shows **origin context**:

- “Generated from: Onboarding Process Step 3”
    
- “Obligation due per NSWINST 1230.1B”
    
- “Work Package: CLD UI Redesign”
    
- “External system: JIRA ABCD-127”
    

---

## **3.3 Task Detail Panel**

A unified, structured view:

- Source System
    
- Purpose
    
- Link to originating entity
    
- Owner (Position + Person)
    
- Due date (Calendar-linked)
    
- Related obligations
    
- Related process steps
    
- Related work package milestones
    
- Required attachments
    
- History log
    
- Execution notes
    
- Comments (optional)
    

This is the first time NSW can answer:

> “Why does this task exist and what does it impact?”

---

## **3.4 Organizational Workload View**

Leadership & Chiefs see:

- Aggregated task volumes
    
- Overdue tasks
    
- SLA breaches
    
- Backlog growth
    
- Workload imbalance across positions & teams
    
- Structural bottlenecks
    
- Workload trendlines
    

This directly feeds COP and Measures.

---

## **3.5 Calendar Integration**

Tasks inject into temporal modeling:

- deadlines
    
- reminders
    
- workload spikes
    
- workload forecasts
    
- sprint windows for engineering
    

Calendar → Task  
Task → Calendar

It becomes a bidirectional temporal backbone.

---

## **3.6 Governance & How-Do Integration**

Completing a task:

- resolves the linked obligation instance
    
- completes the process step
    
- moves workflows forward
    
- generates evidence capture (if required)
    
- updates compliance state
    

Tasks are where governance becomes reality.

---

## **3.7 OKR Integration**

Tasks support:

- KR checkpoints
    
- recurring review cadences
    
- objective-aligned work tracking
    
- leadership insight into execution fidelity
    

---

## **3.8 Work Packages & Commitments Integration**

Tasks:

- represent milestones
    
- connect engineering and non-engineering work
    
- signal dependencies
    
- enable cross-team coordination
    

---

## **3.9 Shadow Tasks (External Tools Integration)**

See Section 6 for full architecture.

Shadow Tasks:

- are read-only mirrors of JIRA/ADO work items
    
- map to Positions
    
- appear in workload views
    
- appear in calendars
    
- appear in Measures & Lenses
    
- feed COP
    
- show external effort without requiring migration
    

Teams stay in their tools.  
Enterprise stays coherent.

---

## **3.10 Task Generation Engine**

See Section 7 for detailed architecture.

The Task Generator listens for events from:

- Governance obligations
    
- Process step activation
    
- Work package milestones
    
- Objective cadences
    
- Request submissions
    
- Calendar triggers
    
- Manual inputs
    

It creates tasks automatically, assigns ownership, and sets deadlines.

---

The system makes tasks meaningful actions, not box-checking.

---

# **5. Data Model**

### **Entities**

`Task ShadowTask TaskAssignment TaskHistoryEvent TaskOriginContext TaskEvidence TaskDependency`

### **Task Fields**

`id title description state ownerType (Position, Org, Person) ownerId dueDate createdAt updatedAt sourceSystem (Internal, Governance, HowDo, OKR, WorkPackage, Request, Calendar, External) sourceRefId priority impactType (readiness, admin load, compliance, risk) effortEstimate tags[] classification`

---

# **6. External Tool Integration (JIRA / ADO / GitHub)**

## **6.1 Work Integration Gateway (Abstract Layer)**

`ExternalWorkItem {     system: "JIRA" | "ADO" | "GitHub"     externalId: string     title: string     description: string     state: string     assignedEmail: string     labels: string[]     createdDate: Date     updatedDate: Date     dueDate?: Date }`

Maps into:

`ShadowTask {     taskId     externalSystem     externalId     title     state     mappedPosition     dueDate     updatedAt }`

## **6.2 Sync Rules**

### **Inbound Sync (always on):**

- Pull changes from JIRA/ADO
    
- Update ShadowTask
    
- Update workload models
    
- Update calendars
    

### **Outbound Sync (only structural events):**

Allowed:

- reassignment due to personnel rotation
    
- required state changes triggered by How-Do or Governance
    

Not allowed:

- user-initiated updates from your app
    
- commentary
    
- freeform editing
    

Your system **reflects**, does not control, external execution.

---

# **7. Task Generation Engine (Semantic Execution Engine)**

A single service subscribed to NSW semantic events.

### **Inputs**

- `ObligationCreated`
    
- `ProcessStepActivated`
    
- `KRCheckpointDue`
    
- `MilestoneDue`
    
- `RequestSubmitted`
    
- `CalendarEventApproaching`
    
- `ManualTaskCreated`
    

### **Actions**

- generate tasks
    
- assign to correct position
    
- set deadlines
    
- produce “TaskCreated” events
    
- publish to Calendar
    
- alert via Member Hub
    

### **Rules**

- Every task must have a valid position owner
    
- Tasks only belong to people as a derivative of position
    
- Deadlines follow SLA rules from How-Do / Governance
    
- If multiple owners possible → RoleTag resolution
    
- External tasks do NOT generate internal tasks

# **8. Event Flows**

## **8.1 Obligation → Task**

`Governance.ObligationTriggered → TaskEngine.createTask → TaskAssigned (position) → Calendar.addEvent → MemberHub.notify → Measures.updateCompliance`

---

## **8.2 How-Do Step → Task**

`Process.StepActivated → TaskEngine.createTask → TaskAssigned → OnCompletion → Process.StepResolved`

---

## **8.3 Work Package → Task**

`WorkPackage.MilestoneDue → TaskEngine.createTask → TaskAssigned → PM oversight`

---

## **8.4 JIRA Ticket → Shadow Task**

`ExternalWorkItemUpdated → ShadowTask.update → Measures.updateWorkload → OrgLoadDashboard.refresh`

---

# **9. Measures & Lenses Integration**

Tasks feed:

- throughput
    
- backlog size
    
- admin load
    
- cycle times
    
- cross-team interactions
    
- compliance timing
    
- effort modeling
    

Every lens gains new fidelity.

---

# **10. COP Integration**

COP receives:

- task heat maps
    
- overdue risk clusters
    
- upcoming workload spikes
    
- structural bottlenecks
    
- readiness impacts
    
- operational tempo signals
    

Tasks become the earliest warning system.

---

# **11. Security & IL5 Considerations**

- All task data stored in IL5-compliant Dataverse or Azure SQL
    
- External integration credentials stored in KeyVault
    
- Ingress-only integration for JIRA/ADO reduces attack surface
    
- Optional outbound actions behind RBAC and audit logs
    
- Tasks may be classified up to FOUO/IL5, not higher
    

---

# **12. Open Questions for Your Decision**

1. Should Members be allowed to manually create tasks, or should this be restricted to Positions only?
    
2. Should Shadow Tasks appear identical in the UI or subtly differentiated?
    
3. Do you want a “Task Delegation” feature?
    
4. Should tasks feed readiness metrics explicitly?
    
5. Should certain tasks be mutually exclusive or blocking tasks for others?
    

---

# **SUMMARY**

This spec turns Task Management into:

- the _execution layer_ of the semantic system
    
- the _workload model_ of NSW
    
- the _operational measurement substrate_ of Measures & Lenses
    
- the _temporal driver_ of Calendar
    
- the _risk signal_ for COP
    
- the _work assignment system_ tied to structure
    
- the _integration gateway_ for existing engineering workflows
    

No other system you build will touch as many domains or have as much influence on making NSW run like a coordinated whole.
