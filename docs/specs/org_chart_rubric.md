# 📏 ORG CHART SYSTEM — VERIFICATION RUBRIC

This rubric is designed to verify that the Org Chart implementation satisfies the **Semantic Digital Backbone** integration requirements and the **"Structure as Physics"** design philosophy.

## 1. Aesthetic & Design Philosophy (The "Interactive Blueprint")

| Criteria | Description | Pass/Fail | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Monoline Geometry** | UI components use minimal, single-line borders (1-1.25px). No heavy shadows or boxes. | | |
| **Dark Canvas** | Primary background is dark; optimized for high-contrast "blueprint" feel. | | |
| **Minimal Noise** | Interface is free of unnecessary chrome, decoration, or non-functional color. | | |
| **Holon Pods** | Organizations, Positions, and People represented as distinct, standardized "Pods". | | |

## 2. Graph Canvas (The Map)

| Criteria | Description | Pass/Fail | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Structure Visualization** | Correctly renders hierarchy: Organization → Position → Person. | | |
| **Visualization Modes** | **Reporting Mode** works (standard hierarchy). | | |
| | **Mission Alignment Mode** connects Pods by Shared Objective. | | |
| | **Process Flow Mode** uses arrows for How-Do/Policy dependencies. | | |
| **Load Indicators** | Ring/meter on Pods showing Task Load vs. Capacity. | | |
| **Compliance Badges** | R/Y/G dots on Pods indicating Policy Obligation risk. | | |
| **Tiger Team Display** | Soft highlighting/connections for cross-functional assignments. | | |

## 3. Discovery Bar (The Compass)

| Criteria | Description | Pass/Fail | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Semantic Search** | Can search by **Competency Tag** (e.g., "Cloud Security"). | | |
| **Objective Search** | Can search by **Strategic Objective** (e.g., "2026 Modernization"). | | |
| **Vacancy Filtering** | One-click filter for vacant positions. | | |
| **Natural Language** | Supports basic semantic queries (e.g., "vacant roles in contracting"). | | |

## 4. Sidebar Panels (The Detail View)

| Criteria | Description | Pass/Fail | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Process Integration** | Org/Position panels list linked **How-Do** processes. | | |
| **Governance Links** | Org panels list **Policy Obligations**. | | |
| **Qualification Provenance** | System displays the source (Policy/SOP) for each qualification. | | |
| **Competence Clarity** | Position panels list *Required Qualifications*; Person panels list *Held Certificates*. | | |
| **Load Visualization** | Person panels show explicit "Current Task Load" meter. | | |

## 5. Roster Builder (The Team Builder)

| Criteria | Description | Pass/Fail | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Two-Column Layout** | Requirements (Left) vs. Talent Pool (Right). | | |
| **Smart Matching** | Scores candidates based on **Reconciliation** (Certificates vs. Qualifications). | | |
| **Load Check** | Warnings displayed if candidate is over-capacity. | | |
| **Trigger Point** | Accessible via "Find eligible members" on vacant Position Sidebar. | | |

## 6. Logic & "Physics"

| Criteria | Description | Pass/Fail | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Governance Checks** | Moving an Org triggers a Policy Governance conflict check. | | |
| **Reconciliation Logic** | System correctly maps *Held Certificates* to *Required Qualifications* (e.g. Sec+ -> IAM2). | | |

## 7. Overall Assessment

- [ ] **Vision Aligned**: Does it feel like a Semantic Digital Backbone?
- [ ] **Performance**: Does the graph render smoothly with large datasets?
- [ ] **Usability**: Is the "Structure as Physics" concept intuitive?
