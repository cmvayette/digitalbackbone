📜 The Tier-1 Design Constitution
These ten principles govern how we build the Org Chart, How-Do, Policy & Governance, and every other system in the portfolio.

I. Respecting the Operator (Your Core 5)
1. Only Once

The Rule: We respect our users have other shit to do. Getting them using our systems is our ideal outcome, so we never ask them for something they've already provided.

In Practice: If the SOM knows it (e.g., your rank, your unit, your current location), the field is pre-filled or hidden. If we ask for it again, it is only to verify, never to collect.

2. No Jargon

The Rule: Technical jargon doesn't make anything smarter or cooler, just more confusing. Call a thing what it is, as the user would understand it.

In Practice: We speak "Navy," not "Data Architect." The interface says "Billet," not "Position Node." It says "Missing Qualification," not "Constraint Violation Error 404."

3. Unique Demonstrable Value

The Rule: Each system needs to provide unique value to its targeted users, distinct from what it does for the ecosystem. The user is not a data entry clerk for the Commodore.

In Practice: If a Platoon Commander updates their status in the Integrated Readiness Status, the system must immediately give them something back—like a cleared task list, an automated report they don't have to write, or a predictive alert that helps them. Give before you take.

4. Absorb Complexity

The Rule: We reduce complexity for those downstream, not increase it. The mess is our problem, not theirs.

In Practice: The backend of the Policy & Governance system might involve complex lineage and graph logic. The user should just see a simple "Approve" button. We hide the physics of the SOM behind simple, intuitive actions.

5. Collaborate Over Compete

The Rule: We prefer to collaborate over compete. No system is an island; no system "owns" the user.

In Practice: Our systems don't hoard data. If How-Do captures a new best practice, it instantly pushes that event to the Reasoning Workbench. We succeed when the user succeeds, not when our specific app has the highest engagement metrics.

II. Ensuring System Integrity (The Necessary Additions)
6. Bias for Action

The Rule: We are building an OODA loop, not a library. Every screen must enable a decision.

In Practice: Static dashboards are forbidden. Every metric in the Enterprise Scorecard must be clickable and link directly to the Project to fix it or the How-Do guide to improve it. Information is always coupled with the mechanism to act on it.

7. Show Your Math

The Rule: Trust is earned through transparency. In a high-stakes environment, the system must explain why.

In Practice: When the Reasoning Workbench makes a prediction, or Policy & Governance blocks an action, it must provide a link to the source. "This is Red because of Instruction 123."

8. Context is King

The Rule: Attention is a combat resource. Showing irrelevant information is a design failure.

In Practice: My Personal Action Center must aggressively filter noise. A Logistics Officer and a SEAL should never see the same home screen. The system uses the Org Chart to know exactly who the user is and shows only what matters to their role.

9. Guardrails, Not Gates

The Rule: We guide users toward the right behavior rather than simply slamming the door when they get it wrong.

In Practice: If a user hits a policy constraint, don't just say "Access Denied." Say, "This requires Qualification X. Click here to launch the training." The system actively helps the user become compliant.

10. Forgiveness by Design

The Rule: The map is not the terrain. Sometimes the model is wrong, or the user makes a mistake.

In Practice: We allow for "Compensating Events." If a user enters the wrong data in Unified Work Commitments, they must be able to issue a correction that preserves the audit trail but fixes the current state. Never force a user to call IT to fix a typo.
